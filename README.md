# Sony-Smartband-2
專題程式。主要串接Google fitness API以從智慧手環取得數據，並使用watch_predict-1.0專案的sklearning隨機森林分析，以判斷使用者當前的運動形式。

It was the team project I did when I was junior. 

The main function is to use SONY SmartBand to monitor user's exercising position and freqency. With machine learning, it can also recognize what type of exercise the user did. Then we can give them some diet and exercising suggestion according to the statistic.

I was responsible for software engineering and my teammate was responsible for machine learning part(not include in this github).
