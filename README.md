# Sony-Smartband-2

It was the team project I did when I was junior. 

The main function is to use SONY SmartBand to monitor user's exercising position and freqency. With machine learning, it can also recognize what type of exercise the user did. Then we can give them some diet and exercising suggestion according to the statistic.

I was responsible for software engineering and my teammate was responsible for machine learning part(not include in this github).
